# 1st Quarter Reflection
_by Timothy Galeos_

# Questions

## 1. List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well.
### 1. Loop Control Structures.
This topic was easy for me to pick up because this was hevily focused on in Grade 8. And since C++ and JS are similar coding languages, I was able to translate my C++ knowledge to JS.

### 2. Variable Declaration.
This topic was very easy for me as the types of declarations (`var`, `let`, and  `const`) were very simple to figure out. It also works very similar to C++, just with less identifiers, making it that much simpler.

### 3. Operators.
This topic was also similar to C++, especially the Logical Operators. Also, JS assignment operators are much simpler compared to in C++ as there are shorthands in JS that make it easier to code fast. And though there are different features between the two, it is still easy ro understand.

### 4. Functions.
Again, this topic is like C++. Functions in JS work like returning functions in C++, and therefore, I was able to understand it easily.

### 5. JS Syntax.
Like all the other topics, this topic is similar to C++. In fact, it is like any other programming language's syntax, from variable naming to how to make your code look nice.

## 2. List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.

I do not have an answer to this question, as I feel like I understand all the topics we discussed this quarter very well, especially the ones listed above. This is evidenced by my good scores in LTs and Exercises.

## 3. Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

Based on my answer to no. 2, I do not have an answer here either. As stated above, I feel like I understand all the topics very well.

## 4. In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

### Effective Activities:
### 1. Speed Tests.

Speed tests were good assessments of our understanding while at the same time making coding competitive among tablemates. I saw my classmates being excited to get their answers checked, which is something a teacher would be very happy about.

### 2. Kahoot.

Kahoot is similar to speed tests, but it made the entire class competitive compared to speed tests being only between tablemates. In my opinion, this is just as effective as speed tests.

### Ineffective Activities:

I do not have an answer for this one for two reasons:
1. Speed Tests and Kahoot were the only sort of activity we had this quarter; and
2. I didn't think either were ineffective at teaching us.
